# Draw connect application

This repository contains the final Python micro-service used in the Draw Connect application.

The Draw Connect application is an implementation of a **passwordless** two-factors authentification (2FA) using the OpenID Connect convention.

It features:

    An online signature verification deep learning model
    An online signature verification using a mathematical processing of the online signatures
    A fully scalable micro-service-oriented architecture using Docker
    An Android mobile application for registration and authentification

The full project is available [here](https://github.com/Furl0w/project-demo-dockercompose).

A full presentation of the architecture of the application is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GzWkUWF6zP6O_7-w712n_CjAQRkWZpn0r_K10MlCfWk/edit?usp=sharing) (in French).
